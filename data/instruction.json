In certain cases, multistage cascading failures can occur. However, existing cascading-failure-mitigation strategies are usually single-stage-based, overlooking the complexity of the multistage scenario. This paper treats the multi-stage cascading failure problem as a reinforcement learning task and develops a simulation environment. The reinforcement learning agent is then trained via the deterministic policy gradient algorithm to achieve continuous actions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems.What are the potential consequences of cascading failures in power grids, and why is it crucial to develop effective mitigation strategies?",

However, this way might overlook the interdependence between stages. On the other hand, if we map the concept of 'each stage ' to the concept of 'each step ' in the RL context, then the MSCF problem can be investigated holistically under various mature frameworks of reinforcement learning, which is the motivation of this paper.\nIn this paper, the DDPG algorithm and the Actor-Critic framework are utilized Lillicrap et al.
